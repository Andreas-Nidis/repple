# Repple

Repple is a full-stack mobile fitness app that helps friends stay accountable through real-time social features, custom workouts, and meal planning — built with React Native, Firebase Auth, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

**Built To Solve:** Most fitness apps are solo tools that forget user experience. Ripple is built around real-time motivation between friends — not just tracking workouts, but sharing the moment.

**Target Users:** Fitness enthusiasts, gym-goers, and friends who want to work out together.

**Tech Stack:** React Native · Firebase Auth · Node.js · Express · PostgreSQL · Socket.IO · TypeScrip
